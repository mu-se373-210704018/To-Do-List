To-Do Application
Problem Definition
The purpose of this application is to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to manage their daily tasks. Many individuals struggle to keep track of various tasks they need to perform throughout their day. With our fast-paced lives, it becomes increasingly challenging to remember and prioritize tasks without overlooking any.
This to-do application aims to mitigate this problem by allowing users to:
•	Add Tasks: Users can input tasks into the application through a text field, ensuring they remember to complete them later.
•	List Tasks: Users can view a list of all the tasks they’ve added, which allows them to see everything at a glance.
•	Mark Tasks as Done: Once a task is completed, users have the satisfaction of marking it as done, which can help with motivation and provide a sense of accomplishment.
•	Visual Feedback for Completion: Completed tasks are visually distinct from pending ones, as they are shown with a strikethrough text. This provides clear and immediate feedback on the progress of the user’s to-do list.
In essence, this to-do application serves as a personal task manager that is always at hand. Its simplicity ensures that it is not only easy to use but also does not distract the user from their main activities throughout the day.
The application is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android, focusing on modern UI design principles and a seamless user experience. With a minimalist design, it avoids overwhelming the user and maintains a focus on functionality and ease of use.
